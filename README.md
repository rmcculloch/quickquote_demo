The demonstration version of the Drupal 7 quickquote module.

to implement a quickquote solution. Viewing the code of this demo version might
be useful to someone who has had problems getting quickquote to work the way they
want. If doing so, however, it is not recommended to clone/copy this repo into
the Drupal modules drectory as it will cause conflicts with the quickquote
module.
